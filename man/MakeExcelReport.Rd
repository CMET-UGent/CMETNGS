\title{Function to automatically generate the Excel-export OTU table}
\usage{
MakeExcelReport(
  shared,
  taxonomy,
  otureps = NULL,
  metadata = NULL,
  resultfn = "Results.xlsx"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shared}{file location string for the shared file
(preferably absolute path)}

\item{taxonomy}{file location string for the taxonomy file (preferably
absolute path)}

\item{otureps}{optional file location for the respresentative fasta file (
preferably absolute path)}

\item{metadata}{optional file location for the metadata.xlsx file (preferably
absolute path)}

\item{resultfn}{desired filename/path (absolute) for the resulting Excel
report. Defaults to Results.xlsx in the current working directory.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the contents of the excel file that was written
}
\description{
This function uses a shared file (i.e. a mothur-formatted OTU contingency
table),a taxonomy file (i.e. an RDP naive bayesian fixed-rank
asignment detail) and an optional fasta file with representative sequences
for every OTU as well as an optional metadata file to be merged into the
CMET style "Excel-report". Currently the metadata file is not being made use
of and the option to use multiple taxonomy references is also to be
implemented at a later date.

\examples{
## Example without otureps
# make sure library(CMETNGS) is loaded
shareddataset <- system.file("extdata","large_shared_file.shared",
                              package = "CMETNGS",mustWork = TRUE)
taxonomydataset <- system.file("extdata","large_OTU_basedtax.taxonomy",
                              package = "CMETNGS",mustWork = TRUE)
reptworeps <- MakeExcelReport(shareddataset,taxonomydataset)

## Example with otureps
oturepsdataset <- system.file("extdata","large_otureps.fasta",
                              package="CMETNGS",mustWork=TRUE)
reptwreps <- MakeExcelReport(shareddataset,taxonomydataset,oturepsdataset,
 resultfn="ResultsOTUreps.xlsx")
