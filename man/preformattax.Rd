  taxonomy,
  OTUtax = TRUE,

  keepProbab = TRUE,
  keepOTU = FALSE,
  keepSize = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxonomy}{is a taxonomy file, raw.}

\item{OTUtax}{is a logical indicating wether we are dealing with a
classify.otu (TRUE) or classify.seqs (FALSE) taxonomy file. Defaults to
TRUE.}

\item{probab}{is a logical indicating whether the classify command was run
with probs =T (i.e. probabilities or bootstrap confidences are included).
Defaults to TRUE (= probs are in the taxonomy file). Currently ignored for
if FALSE.}

\item{keepProbab}{is a logical indicating whether or not to keep the columns
with the probabilities. Defaults to TRUE. Ignored when probab is FALSE}

\item{keepOTU}{is a logical indicating whether or not to include a column with
the OTU names called OTU. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{keepSize}{is a logical indicating whether or not to include a column
that contains the total read count within the OTU. Defaults to FALSE.}
